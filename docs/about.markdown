# Building ML Systems That Work

At Trontal Group, I architect infrastructure for quant trading and ML systems, after working at the Machine Learning Labs at MoneyLion. My focus? Making machine learning work reliably at scale - from serving LLMs to building MLOps platforms used by dozens of data scientists.

## What I Do
- **MLOps & Infrastructure**: Build platforms that help data scientists ship models faster
- **LLM Systems**: Scale language models for production use while keeping latency low
- **Search & Retrieval**: Design semantic search systems that actually find what you need

## Teaching & Writing
When not in the trenches, I share what I've learned. I've taught 1500+ students globally about scaling ML systems and DevOps practices. My writing covers the unvarnished reality of production ML - no hype, just hard-earned lessons.

This blog documents my journey in making ML systems reliable, scalable, and actually useful in production. Expect stories of both triumphs and failures, always with concrete takeaways.
